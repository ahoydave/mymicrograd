# MyMicrograd

Code written when I came across Andrej Karpathy's great video series on DNNs from scratch (see https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=evpoOT5i5Kx8vpeE). Highly recommended.

Most of the code was written after watching the video intro to see if I could get it right - see [exploration.ipynb](exploration.ipynb).

A comparison between my implementation, Karpathy's and a simple PyTorch implementation is in [nn_fitting_comparison.ipynb](nn_fitting_comparison.ipynb)
